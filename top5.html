<h13><strong>My Top 5 Restaurants in Madison</strong></h13>
<dl>
	<dt><strong>Short Stack Eatery</strong></dt>
	<dd>Short Stack has been one of my favorite spots since freshman year. With their unique, delicious menu, they have so much to offer. My favorite things to order from here are the breakfast sandwich and their cinnamon hazelnut iced coffee. This is also my favorite place to go with my parents when they visit me.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Takumi Japanese Restaurant</strong></dt>
	<dd>This spot is sort of a hidden gem; around 20 minutes outside of campus, Takumi has some of the best sushi in Madison. They have a lot of different menu items and their special rolls are to die for (get the Okinawa roll)!</dd>
	<dt><strong>Graze</strong></dt>
	<dd>One of my favorite Capitol restaurants. This place has an excellent farm-to-table menu and has one of the best brunches in Madison. I love their "magic" iced coffee and they have an incredible veggie burger on their dinner menu.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Tempest Oyster Bar</strong></dt>
	<dd>Amazing seafood restaurant a little bit behind the Capitol. While you wouldn't expect great seafood from the Midwest, Tempest proves this assumption wrong with their delicious menu. I like to order the seared tuna and of course the baked oysters for an appetizer to share with friends.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Lucille</dt></strong>
	<dd>This spot is a classic; they have something for everyone on their menu! From pizza to nachos to tacos, this is an amazing restaurant near the Capitol to go with friends or family. They have a really fun atmosphere and adorable outside seating for the summertime.</dd>
