		<p><strong> Hello everyone!</strong></p>
<p> My name is Becca Sklar and I am a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am majoring in Journalism on the Strategic Communications track with a certificate in Digital Studies. I am originally from Scarsdale, NY and I absolutely love living in Madison.</p>
<p>I’m a super creative person, and I love working with my peers and sharing my ideas. I really want to go into communications because I’m very social and want an exuberant, collaborative workspace. I love to write and create, and I hope to utilize new technology to make digital content that will inform and inspire others. I have been enthusiastic about journalism since I was in high school, and I have had the pleasure of working with a number of magazines, newspapers, and online blogs that have allowed me to build important skills and get involved with the field of journalistic writing and digital creation. I have also become very interested in graphic design, and I hope to incorporate the skills I am learning in this field into my career in the future.</p>

<p>In terms of extracurriculars, I have done theatre since I was very young. Aside from being inolved in a number of productions as I grew up, I also worked for my studio as an assistant director and helped put on a number of stage musicals near my hometown. I also am Jewish, which is something that has always been important to me. I was on the board of my chapter of my Jewish youth group, and I remained heavily involved with my synagogue throughout my years in high school. When I came to campus, I discovered a number of Jewish fellowships, such as Hillel and Chabad, where I have been able to connect with other Jews in Madison and engage with services and other fun programs. I also recently spent my summer in Israel, which was an incredibly special experience. Lastly, I am involved with Greek Life at UW-Madison, and it has been so much fun to make friends with so many new girls from all around the country. I am a part of Chi Omega on campus, and we have done a lot of amazing work for our national philanthropy, Make-A-Wish, through large fundraisers and events. I have been an active member for 2 years, and it has been an incredible part of my life here in Madison.</p>

<p>When I'm not in school, I enjoy lots of different fun hobbies. Some of my interests include hanging out with my friends, listening to music, watching movies, dogs, travel, being a foodie, and doing my makeup. I love meeting new people, trying new things, and having an open mind. A fun fact about me is that I have been vegetarian for 13 years! I have loved my time at UW-Madison, and some of my favorite things here are gamedays and the food on campus. My favorite restaurant in Madison has to be Ha Long Bay (check out their website <a href="http://www.halongbaymadison.com/">here</a>). I'm a super adventerous eater and I love Thai food! I'm extremely fun-loving and curious, and I'm looking forward to gaining new opportunities throughout college and in life as a whole.</p>
